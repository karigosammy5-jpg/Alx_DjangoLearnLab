# Deployment Configuration for HTTPS 
1. SSL Certificate: Use Let's Encrypt(Certbot) to generate a free SSl certificate for the domain.
2. Web Server (Nginx) Setup:
- Configure Nginx to listen on port 443 (HTTPS).
- Link the 'ssl_certificate' and 'ssl_certificate_key' to the paths of the generated certificates.
3. Proxy Settings:
- Ensure Nginx passes the X-Forwarded-Proto' header to Django.
- This allows Django's SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT to know the request is already secure.
4. Firewall: Ensure port 443 is open on the server's firewall(UFW/Security Groups).
